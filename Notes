1) Difference Between ClassNotFoundException and  NoClassDefFoundError In Java?

A:-ClassNotFoundException is a run time exception which is thrown when an application tries to load a class at run time using

Class.forName() or loadClass() or findSystemClass() methods and the class with specified name are not found in the classpath

NoClassDefFoundError is an error which is thrown when Java Runtime System tries to load the definition of a class and 

class definition is no longer available. The required class definition was present at compile time but it was missing at run time.

2)What is Re-throwing an exception in java?

A)Exceptions raised in the try block are handled in the catch block. If it is unable to handle that exception, it can re-throw 

that exception using throw keyword. It is called re-throwing an exception.

3)Why it is always recommended that clean up operations like closing the Database and Stream connection resources to keep inside a

finally block?

A:-Because finally block is always executed whether exceptions are raised in the try block or not and raised exceptions 

are caught in the catch block or not. By keeping the clean up operations in finally block, you will ensure that those operations 

will be always executed irrespective of whether exception is occurred or not.
